# pi
Calculate pi using random number generator and pythagorean theorem. One solution in C and the other in C++ using boost libraries.

I wrote this when I was first learning C in 2012. At the time, I had only figured out just enough C++ to come up with the C++ solution. Today I am much more experienced, especially with C++. I may come up with a solution using a better algorithm with more structured code if I run out of other projects to work on (not likely).
