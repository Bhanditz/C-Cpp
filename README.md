# What is this?
This is just a sample of some of my work with C and C++ until I get a completed project uploaded on GitHub. ```pi.c``` and ```pi.cpp``` are very poor indications of my ability so I have moved them to ```bad```. ```ascdesc.cpp``` is just a quick example I put together to show that I am capable of programming in C++.

# ascdesc.cpp
The function ```find()``` parses a string and returns a vector of words without ascender or descender characters. Then we find the biggest one and print that. For example, "The seam remains where it belongs," will result in "remain" being printed.

# pi
Calculate pi using random number generator and pythagorean theorem. One solution in C and the other in C++ using boost libraries.

I wrote this when I was first learning C in 2012. At the time, I had only figured out just enough C++ to come up with the C++ solution. Likewise, these programs are extremely simple and disorganized. They are loaded with global variables and utilize no functions outside of main().

Today I am much more experienced, especially with C++. I may come up with a solution using a better algorithm with more structured code if I run out of other projects to work on (not likely). More likely, I will start uploading my other work in C++ and remove this repository. Until then, this repository exists to show that I have at least a basic understanding of C and C++ syntax. For a better understanding of my programming ability, please see my Associations and JSON-Match-Finder repositories.
