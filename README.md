# pi
Calculate pi using random number generator and pythagorean theorem. One solution in C and the other in C++ using boost libraries.

I wrote this when I was first learning C in 2012. At the time, I had only figured out just enough C++ to come up with the C++ solution. Likewise, these programs are extremely simple and disorganized. They are loaded with global variables and utilize no functions outside of main().

Today I am much more experienced, especially with C++. I may come up with a solution using a better algorithm with more structured code if I run out of other projects to work on (not likely). More likely, I will start uploading my other work in C++ and remove this repository. Until then, this repository exists to show that I have at least a basic understanding of C and C++ syntax. For a better understanding of my programming ability, please see my Associations and JSON-Match-Finder repositories.
